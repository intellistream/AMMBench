RDB2048: Reaction-diffusion Brusselator Model (Chemical Engineering data)
for u and epsilon (0,1) cross (0,1) with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions form a 2D reaction-diffusion model where u and v represent the concentrations of two reactions. The equations are discretized with central differences with grid size hu = hv = 1/(n+1) with n=(N/2)^(1/2). For x^T=[u_{1,1}, v_{1,1},u_{1,2},v_{1,2},...,u_{n,n},v_{n,n}, the discretized equations can be written as x dot = f(x). One wants to compute the rightmost eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix A=df/dx, with the parameters B = 5.45, C = 2, Du = 0.004, Dv = 0.008. The parameter L varies.
