BUS: Optimal power flow problems Power flow in 2400 bus system in western US
Jacobian matrix for an approximately 2400 bus system in the Western United States. The rows represent the equality and some nonlinear constraints of the power flow problem. The first block of columns represents the standard angle and voltage variables of the power flow problem. The last block of columns is very sparse and represents the transformer taps and capacitors.
